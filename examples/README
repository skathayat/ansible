These examples require /etc/ansible/hosts set up with the following sections

[bjarneskvms_ubuntu]
<ip list of vm's with ubuntu>
[bjarneskvms_centos]
<ip list of vm's with centos
[bjarneskvms]
<ip list of all vm's>


Note! If you are not using ansible, do the following steps (in correct order)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Ignore root_ssh.yml file in this directory

2. ntnu_ldap/ldap_ssh.yml file describes the following: 
  - the packages to install, i.e. libnss-ldapd (and its implicit dependencies). In ubuntu, this can be done using commands like 
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install libnss-ldapd 
  - copying the following files from this repository to the VM instance with proper access rights as following
      files/nscd.conf to /ect/nscd.conf with chmod 0600
      files/nslcd.conf to /ect/nslcd.conf with chmod 0400
      files/nsswitch.conf to /ect/nsswitch.conf with chmod 0400

3. Take backup of your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

4. Change your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file as following (in ubuntu)
      PasswordAuthentication yes
      AllowUsers root ubuntu <add your users username here seperated by space>
      AllowGroups root ubuntu <your groups, for example stackit groups or other groups>
      
5. Thats it. Wait, dont logout from your session!

6. You need to restart services now. In ubuntu, following commands can be used
       sudo systemctl restart nslcd
       sudo systemctl restart nscd
       sudo systemctl restart sshd
       
7. Its time to test now. But, do not logout from the current terminal session. Open another terminal and test if you SSH to the VM instance using ntnu username and passwords!!
